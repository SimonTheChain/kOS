kOS Scripts

These are programs written in KerboScript, a language used by the mod kOS for Kerbal Space Program.

They are meant to be used with the mods Real Solar System and Realism Overhaul, among others.

You can see these scripts in action here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCryZPSLRGEoVHswCKTQm2WQ
